Checkbox Selection with Shift Key Support 

This code snippet provides functionality for selecting and unselecting checkboxes within a group using the shift key.

It is designed to work with checkboxes contained within elements having the class 'inbox'.
The implementation allows for selecting multiple checkboxes in sequence by holding down the shift key and clicking.

If a checkbox is already selected and the shift key is pressed while clicking another checkbox, the code will toggle the selection state of the checkboxes in between.
